<h4>
The day i met megha during our elections i didn't quite remember her face..<br>
So I went home to se her fb profile....<br>                        
I saw this good looking girl on fb and i was like,
Okay its gon be cool this year.<br>                        
A few days later there was a meeting..<br><br>
And i was looking at my name which had been misprinted on the notice board,<br>
so i took a pen out and as i moved my hands to correct it....<br>
This girl wearig specs and that bad hair with a sardi wali voice..
Said  in an annoying tone<br>
"Koi zaroorat nahi hai theek karne ki naam , kai logo ka galat hai"<br>
and I had no idea who she was..<br><br>
So in the meeting when the teachers introduced her,
I was a little confused,<br>
But then i went back home and searched for her id again, this time i remembred her face...<br>
And i was like shit this is the same girl..<br><br>
My whole life has been a lie<br><br>
Moral of the story - Do not believe on pic from Social MeDIA<br>
