  <h3 align="center">Rishabh Meets Anant</h3><br>
<h4>
This started around 1st of September.<br>
I had heard about this guy named Anant, but i wasnt really interested in finding out who he was..<br>
Anant's Birthday was on 3rd of September and i remember wishing him,after someone told me it was his birthday.<br>
My opinion of him was like he was a really boring and studious guy and no fun at all..<br><br>

I usually stay away from such people.<br><br>

So around 2 weeks later i am standing at the bus-stop and he appears out of nowhere with 2 more of his friends.<br>
He waved at me and i waved back( i had forgotten what his name was).<br>
from what they were alking i figured he was Anant...<br><br>

There was this Tempo which had its back door open and a box full of Haldiram's Namkeen and Farsan fell from the tempo.<br>
All the people on the bus stop stood like puppets while Anant went and picked it up and brought it to the bus-stand,<br>
We waited for the tempo driver and he did not return for about half an hour...<br>
i Guesss he was getting late for something and so were his friends..<br>
I suggested we leave the box to a nearby shop from where the driver can pick it up...<br>
But Anant wanted to make sure the item reached the Driver, Coz he thought it would be deducted 
from the poor driver's Salary,<br>
So we waited for some more time and the tempo-driver came and picked his box..<br>
(That bastard didnt even thank us)<br><br>
Since it was already late Anant decided to take a rickshaw..<br>
They were already 3 people, Yet he somehow managed to talk to a Rickshaw driver so he could take all 4 of us<br>
Ladka ke SANSKAAR dekho<br><br>

That day i was Awestruck by Anant's Behaviour<br>
Never in my life i had seen someone like this guy & i most probably Never will<br><br>

Moral - Dont judge a book by its Cover<br>
